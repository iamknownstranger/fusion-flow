Creating a Python library with a Rust backend that is equivalent to Ray, a distributed computing framework primarily written in Python, would be a substantial project and beyond the scope of a single response. However, I can provide you with a high-level overview of the steps involved in building such a system:

1. **Project Setup:**
   - Create a new Rust project using Cargo, the Rust package manager.
   - Create a Python package to interface with the Rust library using tools like `setuptools` or `pyo3` to create Python bindings.

2. **Design the API:**
   - Define the API and functionality that your library will provide. Consider the key features of Ray, such as distributed task execution, distributed data storage, and actor-based programming.

3. **Distributed Task Execution:**
   - Implement a system for distributing tasks across multiple nodes or threads in Rust. This might involve creating a task scheduler and worker system.

4. **Distributed Data Storage:**
   - Develop a mechanism for distributed data storage and sharing. You might need to create data structures like distributed queues, tables, or key-value stores.

5. **Actor System:**
   - Implement an actor system that allows for stateful, concurrent programming, similar to Ray's actor model.

6. **Interprocess Communication:**
   - Create a mechanism for interprocess communication between Python and Rust components. You can use tools like FFI (Foreign Function Interface) to call Rust functions from Python.

7. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Implement robust error handling and logging to make the library reliable and user-friendly.

8. **Testing:**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests for both the Rust and Python components.

9. **Documentation:**
   - Create thorough documentation for your library, including usage examples and API references.

10. **Performance Optimization:**
    - Optimize the Rust code for performance, considering aspects like memory management and parallelism.

11. **Packaging and Distribution:**
    - Package your Python library so that users can easily install and use it via tools like pip.

12. **Community and Support:**
    - Foster a community around your library, provide support, and consider open-sourcing it to encourage contributions.

13. **Integration with Python Ecosystem:**
    - Ensure that your library integrates seamlessly with other Python libraries and tools commonly used in the data science and distributed computing space.

14. **Scalability and Fault Tolerance:**
    - Consider implementing features for automatic scalability and fault tolerance, which are essential in distributed systems like Ray.

15. **Performance Benchmarks:**
    - Benchmark your library against Ray and other similar frameworks to assess its performance and scalability.

Creating a Ray-equivalent library with a Rust backend is a complex and ambitious undertaking that requires a deep understanding of both Rust and Python, as well as distributed systems and parallel computing concepts. You may also need to consider lower-level networking and serialization techniques for efficient communication between Rust and Python components. Additionally, the development process will likely involve ongoing maintenance and optimization to make the library competitive with existing solutions like Ray.
